In the meanwhile, the countrymen were getting ready to celebrate the fifth wedding anniversary of the royal couple. Preparations were ready to celebrate the event on a grand scale. One dancing troupe was journeying across a forest, with its drunken chief. This drunken chief stirred the wrath of the wild elephants, who in turn assaulted the whole troupe. While everyone ran amok, one mother fainted with her child trapped in a basket. While the wild elephants were retreating, the child gave a cry. One female elephant grew fond of the child. So she carried the basket with the child on her shoulder and made way into the forest. That forest was home to an ascetic and a Veddah family too. The female elephant had a calf too. The human child grew up with the elephant calf. The ascetic taught him the letters and martial arts, while the Veddah family observed all this from afar.

Anagarika Dharmapala SreemathanoAnagarika Dharmapala Sreemathano Anagarika Dharmapala Sreemathano Sinahawa AtharinSinahawa Atharin Sinahawa Atharin Usaviya NihadayiTwo women from a farming village about 100 kilometers from the country’s capital were raped within one year by a court judge presiding over cases which involved their husbands as accused parties. They have gone to Judiciary Services Commission, the BAR Association and to the president of the country to seek justice. Those institutions and people were non-responsive to their complaints. Angered husbands of two women swear revenge but their efforts to avenge the judge are futile. An editor of a leading alternative newspaper publishes the story of one of the women. He continues to follow up the incident and publish a series of articles exposing the judge’s misdeed. Still, the Attorney General refuses to take action in reprimanding the judge. The newspaper editor pursues the truth with mounting peer pressure, three years after the incidents, the Judiciary Services Commission appoints a tribunal consisting three high court judges to investigate the accusations made by the newspaper. The tribunal finds the judge to be guilty of all charges. Yet, instead of dismissing the judge from his duties, the Judiciary Service Commission sends him on compulsory leave with pay. The two women’s family lives have been destroyed. After failing to gain justice, the newspaper editor focuses his struggles against the Attorney General who covered up the case. When the Attorney General is up for appointment as the Chief Justice of the country, the newspaper editor writes a book about the system’s failure to deliver justice to commoners based on these women’s’ stories. Nevertheless, 14 years later, today, the editor and the two women are still waiting for justice to be served. In year 2014, a filmmaker embarks on a journey to unearth these events and searches for the root causes of this ongoing injustice.

This includes recycling and green initiatives, adhering to company policies and business processes to optimize space utilization, minimize wastage of any kind while maximizing productivity. Furthermore, through the continuous introduction of technological changes and initiation of projects such as i-Sri Lanka and NGN, we help to reduce overall power and space consumption. Our products enable people and businesses all over the world to reduce local and international travel everyday whilst remaining connected to loved ones or opportunity, thus enabling reduction of the carbon footprint of all mankind. This is our greatest contribution to the environment although it cannot be measured. We are also mindful of the necessarily large footprint the organisation makes in providing enabling technologies and strive to manage and minimise it as part. our approch of our business processes as there are substantial benefits to be gained as a result of lean consumption and waste management. Inculcating the concepts of sustainability in this manner ensures that there is continuity of measures taken to identify, monitor and manage the key issues as part of the business objectives of the Company, an imperative for continued action on sustainability. Employees are engaged in these initiatives as well by educating field staff on minimising environment pollution and damages including minimising the cutting down of trees and finding alternative ways of carrying out daily activities such as cabling etc. without harming the existing geographic landscapes. Educating employees on environment pollution and its threat to life as well as educating and encouraging ways of minimising wastage through SLT’s bi-monthly magazine Amathuma, emails, posters and seminars is an ongoing programme. As a responsible corporate citizen we are aware that there is more that needs to be done and are inspired to push the boundaries by our achievements so far. Embracing a strategic approach to energy management, SLT has always advocated the deployment of energy efficient technologies and the application of best practices for energy management at all levels of the business. Accordingly a meticulously laid out energy policy spells out suitable action for each aspect of the business. Moreover, underscored by continuous evaluation, SLT seeks to improve existing systems and practices through training programmes, site assessments and timely realignment of policies and practices to satisfy the changing needs of the business. Establishing Best Practices for Energy Management Reducing energy costs remains a key priority for SLT, not only as a means of trimming operational expenses, but also to mitigate the impact on the environment and subscribe to a more sustainable business model in the longer term. To accomplish these goals, SLT made a tactical move during the year 2013 to set up an appropriate framework that would support the company’s aim to build sustainable energy management practices in the long term. By appointing the Energy Management Committee as the apex body overseeing the scope of all energy related activities in the company, SLT set up an Energy Council and appointed Energy Ambassadors, during the year, to inculcate the energy saving philosophy among SLT’s employees. A number of key initiatives were launched by the newly appointed Energy Council, as a first step towards adopting a positive approach towards energy management. Key among these steps was the launch of the “Energy Conservation Week”.

As the national telecommunication service provider, we empower organizations to perform their business activities more efficiently and effectively through our island-wide ICT infrastructure and the provision of reliable and high quality ICT products and services, helping to create a knowledge rich society, aiding economic development. Through the provision of high speed, affordable broadband connectivity we seek to bring about social and economic benefits for the people in Sri Lanka. We are fully committed to making broadband affordable, and to connecting every home and bringing people online to facilitate national GDP growth. SLT will also deliver the National Backbone Network (NBN) services as the NBN operator, creating the network and capability to empower Sri Lanka as South Asia’s economic hub.  Our effort to reengineer the entire network towards a fully fledged Next Generation Network (NGN) is well underway. In parallel, SLT’s capacity building effort is taking care of upgrading the core backbone and establishing the National Backbone Network (NBN) - as the sole NBN licence holder. While revolutionizing SLT’s core infrastructure platform, NGN is expected to transform Sri Lanka’s ICT readiness by replacing conventional legacy platforms in favour of an optical fibre based backbone network that extends the network edge closer to the customer. With NGN migration being a pre-requisite for Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) licensing requirements, the progress made towards NGN migration during the year helped secure SLT’s operating license, for a further period of 10 years.

Our products enable people and businesses all over the world to reduce local and international travel everyday whilst remaining connected to loved ones or opportunity, thus enabling reduction of the carbon footprint of all mankind. This is our greatest contribution to the environment although it cannot be measured. We are also mindful of the necessarily large footprint the organisation makes in providing enabling technologies and strive to manage and minimise it as part. our approch of our business processes as there are substantial benefits to be gained as a result of lean consumption and waste management. Inculcating the concepts of sustainability in this manner ensures that there is continuity of measures taken to identify, monitor and manage the key issues as part of the business objectives of the Company, an imperative for continued action on sustainability. Employees are engaged in these initiatives as well by educating field staff on minimising environment pollution and damages including minimising the cutting down of trees and finding alternative ways of carrying out daily activities such as cabling etc. without harming the existing geographic landscapes. Educating employees on environment pollution and its threat to life as well as educating and encouraging ways of minimising wastage through SLT’s bi-monthly magazine Amathuma, emails, posters and seminars is an ongoing programme. As a responsible corporate citizen we are aware that there is more that needs to be done and are inspired to push the boundaries by our achievements so far. Embracing a strategic approach to energy management, SLT has always advocated the deployment of energy efficient technologies and the application of best practices for energy management at all levels of the business. Accordingly a meticulously laid out energy policy spells out suitable action for each aspect of the business. Moreover, underscored by continuous evaluation, SLT seeks to improve existing systems and practices through training programmes, site assessments and timely realignment of policies and practices to satisfy the changing needs of the business. Establishing Best Practices for Energy Management Reducing energy costs remains a key priority for SLT, not only as a means of trimming operational expenses, but also to mitigate the impact on the environment and subscribe to a more sustainable business model in the longer term. To accomplish these goals, SLT made a tactical move during the year 2013 to set up an appropriate framework that would support the company’s aim to build sustainable energy management practices in the long term. By appointing the Energy Management Committee as the apex body overseeing the scope of all energy related activities in the company, SLT set up an Energy Council and appointed Energy Ambassadors, during the year, to inculcate the energy saving philosophy among SLT’s employees. A number of key initiatives were launched by the newly appointed Energy Council, as a first step towards adopting a positive approach towards energy management. Key among these steps was the launch of the “Energy Conservation Week”.

With this theme SLT wishes re-emphasize the value of art and to project historical background and different artistic methods to the future generations.  2020 :Narration of Art 2019 :Splendors of Water 2018 :Connected Lifestyles of Sri Lanka 2017 :Traditional Rice of Sri Lanka. 2016 :Wild Fruits of Sri Lanka. 2015 :Corals of Sri Lanka. Past SLT calendars have been produced under themes such as Medicinal Plants, Endemic Birds, Orchids, Fresh Water Fish, Gok Kalawa, Corals of Sri Lanka. and Kolam Masks of Sri Lanka. The 2009 calendar focused on Endemic Butterflies of Sri Lanka. With butterfly species declining the world over due to increased and careless use of pesticides and insecticides, it was deemed that while Sri Lanka's butterfly population is yet not endangered, it would be timely to create awareness of the danger they were in and appreciate the beauty of these amazing insects. Sri Lanka Telecom continues to facilitate inplant training by providing comprehensive on-the-job training for students from various  institutes and universities island-wide at SLT’s premises with state of the art facilities. These programs include practical training programmes that allow for study area rotation in such a way that allows the students to gain exposure to the latest technologies available today. We have been providing training under various fields such as engineering, information technology, marketing, human resources, finance etc.  Continuing with the book donation agenda founded in 2004, in partnership with the Asia Foundation, a series of distribution programmes were conducted in 2013 as well. An important community investment to enhance information, education and English Language skills of students and teachers across the island, the programme which was initiated under the theme “Spreading the wealth of knowledge”, seeks to distribute books and other educational materials to libraries in a range of institutes across the island including schools, universities, vocational institutes as well as other organizations, with an annual distribution of over 100,000 books. In a bid to bridge the country’s skills gap and attract greater foreign direct investment, SLT strongly supported Sri Lanka’s efforts to showcase the country’s technological and ICT capabilities vis-à-vis a number of high profile forums and exhibitions.

As the national telecommunication service provider, we empower organizations to perform their business activities more efficiently and effectively through our island-wide ICT infrastructure and the provision of reliable and high quality ICT products and services, helping to create a knowledge rich society, aiding economic development. Through the provision of high speed, affordable broadband connectivity we seek to bring about social and economic benefits for the people in Sri Lanka. We are fully committed to making broadband affordable, and to connecting every home and bringing people online to facilitate national GDP growth. SLT will also deliver the National Backbone Network (NBN) services as the NBN operator, creating the network and capability to empower Sri Lanka as South Asia’s economic hub.  Our effort to reengineer the entire network towards a fully fledged Next Generation Network (NGN) is well underway. In parallel, SLT’s capacity building effort is taking care of upgrading the core backbone and establishing the National Backbone Network (NBN) - as the sole NBN licence holder. While revolutionizing SLT’s core infrastructure platform, NGN is expected to transform Sri Lanka’s ICT readiness by replacing conventional legacy platforms in favour of an optical fibre based backbone network that extends the network edge closer to the customer. With NGN migration being a pre-requisite for Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) licensing requirements, the progress made towards NGN migration during the year helped secure SLT’s operating license, for a further period of 10 years.
